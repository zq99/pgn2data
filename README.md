# pgn2data library

A library that converts chess pgn files into CSV tabulated data sets.

A pgn file can contain one or multiple chess games. The library parses the pgn file and creates two csv files:

- Games file: contains high level information (e.g. date, site, event, score, players etc...)

- Moves file: contains the moves for each game  (e.g. notation, squares, fen position, is in check etc...)

The two files can be mapped together using a GUID which the process inserts into both files.



## Installation

Run the following command on the python terminal:

    pip install pgn2data
    
   
   
## Implementation

Here is a basic example of how to convert a PGN file:

    from converter.pgn_data import PGNData
    
    pgn_data = PGNData("tal_bronstein_1982.pgn")
    result = pgn_data.export()
    result.print_summary()
    
The return value from the export function allows you to check whether the datasets have been created or not.

To group multiple files into the same output file you can do the following:

    pgn_data = PGNData(["file1.pgn","file2.pgn"],"output")
    result = pgn_data.export()
    result.print_summary()
    
This processes the two pgn files in the specified list and exports them to file called "output.csv".



## Columns

This is a list of the columns in each dataset:
