This library converts chess pgn files into CSV tabulated data sets.

A pgn file can contain one or multiple chess games. The library parses the pgn file and creates two csv files:

- Games file: contains high level information (e.g. date, site, event, score, players etc...)

- Moves file: contains the moves for each game  (e.g. notation, squares, fen position, is in check etc...)

The two files can be mapped together using a GUID which the process inserts into both files.


## Installation

The library requires Python 3.7 or later.  
 
To install, type the following command on the python terminal:

    pip install pgn2data
    
  
## Implementation

Here is a basic example of how to convert a PGN file:

    from converter.pgn_data import PGNData
    
    pgn_data = PGNData("tal_bronstein_1982.pgn")
    pgn_data.export()

The following is an example of grouping multiple files into the same output file ("output.csv").

    pgn_data = PGNData(["file1.pgn","file2.pgn"],"output")
    pgn_data.export()
    
The export function has a return object which allows you to quickly check the size and location of the files created:

    pgn_data = PGNData("tal_bronstein_1982.pgn")
    result = pgn_data.export()
    result.print_summary()

If you want to check if the files have been created before doing further processing you can do the following:

    pgn_data = PGNData("tal_bronstein_1982.pgn")
    result = pgn_data.export()
    if result.is_complete:
        print("Files created!")
    else:
        print("Files not created!")

The result object also provides methods to import the created files into pandas dataframes:

    pgn_data = PGNData("tal_bronstein_1982.pgn")
    result = pgn_data.export()
    if result.is_complete:
        
        # read the games file
        games_df = result.get_games_df()
        print(games_df.head())
        
        # read the moves file
        moves_df = result.get_moves_df()
        print(moves_df.head())
        
        # read both files joined together
        combined_df = result.get_combined_df()
        print(combined_df.head())

To output the game information only, you can do the following:
    
    from converter.pgn_data import PGNData
    
    pgn_data = PGNData("tal_bronstein_1982.pgn")
    pgn_data.export(moves_required=False)


## Examples

The folder 'samples' in this repository, has some examples of the output from the library.

You can also go [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zq1200/magnus-carlsen-lichess-games-dataset) to see a Kaggle project that converted all of Magnus Carlsen's online Bullet games
into CSV format.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, all modifications should come with appropriate tests demonstrating
an issue has been resolved, or new functionality is working as intended. Pull Requests without tests
will not be merged.

The library can be tested by doing the following:

    from testing.tests import run_all_tests
    run_all_tests()

New tests should be added to the above method.
